abstract="In this paper, we present LearnLib, a library for active automata learning. The current, open-source version of LearnLib was completely rewritten from scratch, incorporating the lessons learned from the decade-spanning development process of the previous versions of LearnLib. Like its immediate predecessor, the open-source LearnLib is written in Java to enable a high degree of flexibility and extensibility, while at the same time providing a performance that allows for large-scale applications. Additionally, LearnLib provides facilities for visualizing the progress of learning algorithms in detail, thus complementing its applicability in research and industrial contexts with an educational aspect.
