\chapter{Research}\label{research}

This chapter will explain the setup used to infer the state machine of a TDLS implementation.
First we will review LearnLib and StateLearner, the tooling used for the inferring. Next we will take a look at the mapper, which is used to convert input and output symbols used by StateLearner to the right TDLS messages. And last we will focus on the assumptions made for this research, plus the final setup used.
