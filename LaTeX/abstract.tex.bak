\begin{abstract}
The usage increase of the internet and in specific wireless networks has introduced new difficulties in keeping reliable connections. TDLS creates a direct link between two communicating clients improving reliability for all other clients. This protocol is a part of the IEEE 802.11 specification \cite{80211} and includes measures to secure the direct link. The specification is over 3000 pages long. This may introduce problems for software engineers creating a new implementation of TDLS. Writing such an implementation is hard and bugs can be introduced in the process, weakening the security of a direct link.
We will introduce a method to automatically infer state machines of TDLS implementations. This allows us to get insight in the conformity of such implementations to the specification.
We will utilise the L* and the randomwords algorithms to execute the inferring process on the wpa\_supplicant implementation of TDLS by utilising our own mapper. By analysing the results of this process we will show that TDLS state machines can be inferred sucessfully and that inferring such state machines can improve our knowledge about the inner workings of protocols.
