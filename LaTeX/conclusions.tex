\chapter{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
\iffalse
In this chapter you present all conclusions that can be drawn from the
preceding chapters.
It should not introduce new experiments, theories, investigations, etc.:
these should have been written down earlier in the thesis.
Therefore, conclusions can be brief and to the point.

In this research we've shown that this method of inferring the TDLS state machine is not ideal. This does not mean that this method is not useful for researching protocols.
Future work is required to come to a better understanding of the TDLS state machine implementations.
