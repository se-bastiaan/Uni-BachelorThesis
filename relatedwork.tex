Analysing protocols by inferring the state machine is not a new concept. It has been used before to learn state machines of EMV cards \cite{bankcards}, and hand-held readers used for internet banking \cite{identifier}. Additionally, the TCP \cite{tcpchecking}, TLS \cite{tlsfuzzing} and SSH \cite{sshchecking} protocols have been subject to this type of testing. In the case of TLS several security flaws were found in different implementations, the research into TCP revealed ways to fingerprint remote operating systems.
